- time and day
	- probably a datetime call
	- Goal:
		- make a function that returns the date in a format that you want as a string
		- make a function that returns the time in a format that you want as a string
		- print that stuff out to the console one after another
			- these prints should probably be in a "if __name__ == '__main__':" block so that you don't get random prints if you import this file (or "module") from another file
- weather
	- use 'requests' module probably
	- as a starting point, it's probably better to just get the current temperature and whatnot and deal with the rest later (unless, of course, it's super simple to get everything you want at once)
	- should be a pretty simple curl command?
	- Goal:
		- make a function that gets the temperature from the www
		- print it to the console
			- again, do the __name__=='__main__' thing
- graphics
	- use tkinter
	- probably need to make a Frame child class?
		- that's probably the best way to do it even if it's not needed
	- I think it'd be good to import time/day and weather information and just be able to display that stuff everywhere nice and aligned (probably with a bunch of pack() calls or like a grid layout option. I think that's a thing)
	- once you get that done, you'll probably have a good idea on how you data should be formatted in order to display it easily
		- maybe go back to the time/day and weather modules and rework them if you came up with a better way to do it here
	- Goal:
		- open a window and be able to put the data from the other modules at different places
			- ideally, you'd be using some built in alignment tools instead of hardcoding in x,y values to put everything in the right places
